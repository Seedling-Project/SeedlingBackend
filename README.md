# SeedlingEducation
This is an attempt at creating a web server project for the benefit of Modesto Junior College and the communities affected by it. It serves as a hub of information for those motivated enough to seek out opportunities beyond the immediate. It serves as a resource of education that enriches the classes and allows for those struggling to have tailored help. Through this project, the seedlings at this school hope to grow into towering trees. 

The central idea differs from CommunityALI or the MJC Website because this website is more verbose and focuses on a connection between the students and the school. As such, a "bloggy" type of model has been adapted into the formulation of the website. It will also be actively maintained by students and have a minimal bloat and minimal bureaucratic approach.
